<p>Hello, Ligerbots! This blog will be updated after every meeting to make sure everybody is up to date on what&#39;s going on. If you miss a meeting, please check the blog to make sure you know what you&#39;ve missed! &lt;3 Lily -- Thursday, November 13, 2014 Group portion: Sean ran the meeting. We went over information for Battle of the Bay on Saturday 11/15. Also, everybody needs to get your carpool forms in, regardless of whether you think you&#39;ll be using carpools at this point. Game Breakdown: Run by Sean and Vikram. Watched 2010 game animation, brainstormed ways of mechanically, tactically, and strategically developing and building the robot. Creo: Run by Alex S. and Noa Rensing. General Creo-learning workshop. Participants learned how to and built parts for a pre made assembly. Most participants got through the first portion of the workshop, and some participants began the second portion. Outreach: Run by Rachel and Lily. Went over progress from past week and set goals for upcoming week. If anyone would like to add to the Ligerbots newsletter for Novemeber, please contact Rachel ASAP. Lily --</p>
