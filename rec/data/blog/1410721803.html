<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the new home of the Ligerbots!</p>

<p>After a number of issues with the previous website setup the team had, we decided it would be best to move onto a newer, more reliable hosting provider, and switch to a more lightweight web platform.&nbsp; Because of that, a few things might be different now.</p>

<p>First of all, <strong>All team members need to re-register for the website by clicking on Register in the upper right.</strong></p>

<p>Second of all, It is recommended that everybody uses a modern browser, as this website utilizes a number of features that may not be available in browsers that do not support HTML5 or CSS3.</p>

<p>Third of all, if you break the website, please let one of the webmasters (Max, Paul, or Nicholas) know, so we can fix the issue ASAP.&nbsp; Or just don&#39;t break the website in the first place.&nbsp; That would be nice.</p>

<p>Fourth, if your job for this year is to post content to the website, please contact one of the website administrators (Executives, IT Team members, and coaches) so that we can give you permission to post on the website.</p>

<p>Fifth, There are still a few features of the website that are under construction and/or are not fully functional yet.&nbsp; If there is a feature you would like added to the website, or a feature that is behaving strangely, feel free to contact Nick or Max and we&#39;ll get it sorted out for you in no time at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all you need to know for now, and I hope the website works out for everybody!&nbsp; See you all at the next meeting!</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Nicholas</p>
