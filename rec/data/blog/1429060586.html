<p>During our competition at Northeastern from March 27-28, FRC team 2877, the LigerBots, were chosen to be part of the second seed alliance along with team 1768 and 663; with our new teammates, we made it all the way to the finals which ended in two very close matches. After our performance at Northeastern, our team moved on to the regional championships at WPI which took place from April 9 to 11. After an intense series of 120 qualification matches, The LigerBots became the captain of the sixth seed alliance and chose team 230 and 558 to participate with us. During Quarterfinals match 2, the LigerBots received a standing ovation when

<p>During the awards ceremony, the LigerBots won the regional Chairman&#39;s award and secured our place as one of the top 10 New England teams to qualify for St. Louis. The Chairman&rsquo;s Award is given once at each district competition for to the team that best represents a model for others to emulate, and embodies the purpose and goals of FIRST. At the regional championships, all the district winners are given a chance to compete against the other recipients; however, only four presentations are chosen to compete in St. Louis against teams from all over the world. In order to receive this prestigious award, a group of students must showcase the work they have done for the community by creating a written response to present directly to a panel of judges and to film a video demonstrating the impact we have made.</p>

<p>This year, the LigerBots are hoping to perform just as well at St. Louis, and are currently raising more funds to help get the team there.
