<p>On Wednesday October 29, from 7-9 PM, Newton&#39;s combined high school FIRST Robotics Team, the Ligerbots, will hold a meeting for parents in the Newton North High School Film lecture hall (the room is located to the left of the Tiger Drive entrance of Newton North right under the staircase). &nbsp;At the meeting, students and coaches on the team will present&nbsp;what the team is, how the team functions, and how the year will progress. We especially invite parents of new team members, as well as parents who think their children might be interested in robotics, business, and design; parents of returning students are also encouraged to attend, meet the coaches, and learn more about our plans for the upcoming year.</p>
