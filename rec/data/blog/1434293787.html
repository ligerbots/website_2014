<p>Are you interested in robotics for your elementary or middle school student?</p>

<p>The LigerBots invite you to find out more at an information night for FIRST LEGO League (FLL&reg;) - robotics for 4-8th grade.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June&nbsp;24th<br />
7-9 pm<br />
Newton North High School<br />
Film Lecture Hall</p>

<p>For directions, see this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zxD5aIyoOQF4.kKJHm1QG3wSY" target="_blank">map</a>. 
The Film Lecture Hall is located just off the main school lobby. There should be plenty of parking off of Elm Rd (enter from Lowell or Walnut Streets).</p>

<p>In FLL, teams of up to 10 students, ages 9-14, are immersed in real world science and technology challenges. Teams research and design their own solution to a current scientific question or problem and build autonomous LEGO&nbsp;robots that perform a series of missions. This year&#39;s challenge is <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2015trashtrek" target="_blank">Trash Trek</a>.</p>
