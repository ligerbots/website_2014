<p><strong>Support Newton&#39;s award winning high school robotics team!!!!!</strong></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last year, LigerBots&nbsp;was ranked 8th in New England&nbsp;and advanced to the world championships in St. Louis. However, competition is a costly undertaking;&nbsp;on any given year, competing in the qualifiers alone costs the team around $20,000.00 between&nbsp;build costs and competition fees. Last year our costs were close to triple that amount, due to travel&nbsp;and added competition fees. Due to our high cost of operation,<strong> we count on support from our community</strong> in order for the team to continue operation. Throughout the entire month of January, the team will be having a fundraiser at Whole Foods Market on Walnut St. <strong>(916 Walnut Street, Newtonville, MA 02461)</strong>. Our goal for this fundraiser is to raise $1,000.00 by the end of the month.&nbsp;Members of the team will be&nbsp;present at Whole Foods after school&nbsp;and on weekends to talk about the team, and about FIRST. Donation coupons of varying amounts&nbsp;will be available for purchase at checkout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check in periodically for updates on the fundraiser, updates on the team, as well as answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
