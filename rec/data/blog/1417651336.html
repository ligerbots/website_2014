<h3>Hello All! Apologies for the absence of posts last week.</h3>

<hr />
<p>We started off Monday&#39;s meeting with a name game.&nbsp;Max ran the meeting: we collected money from Candy Box sales, and discussed our upcoming fundraiser at Yogurt Beach (see the handy-dandy flyer at the bottom of the post for more info). If you can volunteer to present the robot between 5pm and 10pm this thursday, email Ben Gross at &nbsp;&lt;<a href=\"\\\" target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\">ben_gross@ligerbots.com</a>&gt;. After that we took a photo for the South yearbook and split into groups.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Outreach:</strong>&nbsp;Created a basic promotional flyer to be used for many LigerBots events. Created a basic template for this year&#39;s business plan&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chassis:</strong>&nbsp;Started cutting the bottom plates out of plywood so it will clear the brackets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Battery Box:</strong>&nbsp;Finished up/corrected problems in the CAD. Established need for half-inch plywood instead of three-quarters. Decided how to mount wheels. Worked on structural supports.</p>

<p><strong>Programming:</strong>&nbsp;Worked on downloading code onto the Robot.</p>

<hr />
<h3>***Remember: No Meeting on Thursday! Go to Yogurt Beach instead!***</h3>
